Assembly-Language-Project
Decompiler which translates machine code into assembly language.

How to run program:

1) Download an assembly language compiler such as easy68k
2) Save TestCode-13.S68 somewhere where you can easily find it
3) Copy, paste Man Power_F14.X68 from this repository into editor and click run
4) In the screen that comes up, (for easy68k) hit file -> open data, and select TestCode-13.S68 from location where you saved it
5) Click run again
6) Follow the prompt (quick example that works - 8000 + *enter*, 9000 + *enter*)
7) Continue pressing enter until test code runs out (you will get error messages once there is no more data to be processed)
