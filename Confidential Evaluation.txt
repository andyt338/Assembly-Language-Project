Confidential Evaluation

1)I did the opcodes, most of the EA's, and some of the I/O.
As a team, we didn't really divide up our tasks, we just 
worked on the project as a whole together. There wasn't really
much organization and we didn't really know what we were doing
with our design and what not until there were like 3 weeks
left in the quarter, so we really had to scramble.  I ended up
doing a lot of the work, but it wasn't necessarily because I was
working harder, but because I wrote a lot of the initial stuff.
Once I had all the opcodes done, it was easy for me to quickly
branch from those print statements into different EA modes, while
the other 2 were just trying to understand how my code worked.

It's easier to write more code when you're familiar with it,
and maybe I didn't do a good enough job of that.  But all in 
all we all pulled our own weight and I'm happy with the 
contributions my teammates made.

2)Yezen did most of the I/O, some of the EA's, and some other
functions like converting strings to hex, and decimal to hex.
Race did some of the I/O, a lot of the documentation and overall
design, commenting, and some of the EA's.

3) I contributed about 60% of the project.
4) Yezen - 30%
   Race - 10%
